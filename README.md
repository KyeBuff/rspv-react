# RSVP - React app
Challenge set as part of the Treehouse Learn React track. I was provided with a static website that needed to be converted into a React app.

## Getting Started
The app can be installed by cloning the Git repository and running 'npm install' in the project directory. Once all packages are installed, you can run 'npm start' to run the app in localhost.

## Prerequisites
You are required to have NPM installed to run this app.

## Built With
This application was built using Create React App. 

## Acknowledgments
Whilst I had programmed the app's functionality. Treehouse provided the styling and initial static application files. 

This was my first attempt at building a React app alone, and helped me understand the ideas behind stateless and stateful components.
